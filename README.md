Doing a little bit of research/work on integrating scheduling into Google Calendar
Coursera, edX, and other online learning applications have very limited flexibility when it comes to customizing the scheduling of the course - despite the entire appeal and benefit of online education being self-paced.
There is an integrated Google Calendar in Coursera that I've found, but it will only link to whatever is already preset in the course, and wouldn't be able to be adjusted outside of manually addressing each lesson.
GOAL: to have a firm understanding of how to integrate into Google Suite applications, and develop a program that I can use to customize scheduling.
